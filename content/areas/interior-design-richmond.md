Richmond upon Thames offers the best of both worlds: easy access to central London combined with riverside beauty, royal parkland, and a thriving high street. It is no wonder so many families and professionals choose to make their homes here.

## Richmond's Unique Character

The borough encompasses Richmond Hill, East Sheen, Kew, and Twickenham, each with its own personality. Properties range from Georgian townhouses overlooking the Thames to Edwardian semis and contemporary riverside developments.

**Riverside Living**
Properties with Thames views command premium prices and deserve interiors that maximise the connection to the water. Large windows, reflective surfaces, and colour palettes inspired by the river create homes that celebrate their location.

**Period Character**
Richmond's conservation areas protect much of its architectural heritage. We work sensitively within these constraints, enhancing period features while introducing modern functionality.

## Designing for Richmond Lifestyles

Richmond residents tend to be active and outdoorsy, making use of Richmond Park, the Thames towpath, and excellent sports facilities. Homes need to accommodate muddy boots, sports equipment, and the transition from outdoor adventures to indoor comfort.

**Entrance and Boot Room Design**
Practical spaces that contain outdoor mess while maintaining the aesthetic of the home. Built-in storage, durable flooring, and good lighting transform these hardworking areas.

**Indoor-Outdoor Flow**
Many Richmond homes have gardens, and we design to maximise the connection between inside and out. Bifold doors, consistent flooring materials, and thoughtful furniture placement extend living space into the garden.

## Our Work in Richmond

We have designed homes throughout the borough, understanding the subtle differences between neighbourhoods and what each demands:

- Complete renovation of a Georgian property on Richmond Hill
- Kitchen and family room extension in East Sheen
- Contemporary apartment near Richmond station
- Period townhouse refresh in Twickenham

## Conservation and Planning

Working in Richmond often involves navigating conservation area guidelines and, occasionally, listed building consent. We have established relationships with local planning officers and understand what is likely to be approved. This experience helps us set realistic expectations and design schemes that gain necessary permissions.
