Kent, the Garden of England, stretches from the London commuter belt to the Channel coast. The county offers extraordinary variety, from the historic streets of Canterbury to the white cliffs of Dover, the vineyards of the North Downs to the marshlands of Romney.

## Kent's Diverse Properties

The county's varied geography is matched by its property styles:

**Oast Houses and Farmsteads**
Kent's agricultural heritage has left a legacy of distinctive buildings now converted to residential use. These unique properties require specialist design approaches that respect their origins.

**Coastal Properties**
From Whitstable's weatherboard cottages to the Edwardian villas of Broadstairs, coastal Kent has its own aesthetic. Designs must consider light, salt air, and the connection to the sea.

**Wealden Villages**
The Kent Weald is dotted with beautiful villages where timber-framed houses, medieval hall houses, and Georgian rectories sit alongside later Victorian and Edwardian properties.

## Understanding Kent Living

Kent residents enjoy a quality of life that combines rural beauty with good transport links to London. Many work from home part of the week, requiring flexible spaces that accommodate professional life.

**Home Office Design**
Creating workspaces that function effectively while integrating with the aesthetic of the home. From dedicated studies to cleverly concealed work areas.

**Entertaining Spaces**
Kent homes often have the space for proper entertaining. We design kitchens that cater, dining rooms that impress, and living spaces that accommodate large gatherings.

## Regional Expertise

We have worked throughout Kent, understanding the distinct character of different areas:

**North Kent**
Commuter towns like Sevenoaks and Tunbridge Wells, where period properties meet contemporary expectations.

**East Kent**
Canterbury, Whitstable, and the coastal towns where historic buildings and sea views create unique design opportunities.

**The Weald**
Rolling countryside and picturesque villages where traditional materials and craftsmanship feel most appropriate.
