Surrey offers a different pace of life to London while remaining well-connected to the capital. From Guildford to Woking, Esher to Reigate, the county is home to families and professionals who value space, greenery, and quality of life.

## Surrey Home Styles

The county encompasses diverse property types, from commuter-belt estates to historic villages with cottages and manor houses.

**Country Houses**
Larger properties with multiple reception rooms, outbuildings, and generous gardens. These homes call for designs that feel appropriately scaled without becoming impractical for modern living.

**Village Properties**
Cottages, rectories, and farmhouses with period character. Low ceilings, uneven floors, and small windows present challenges that require creative solutions.

**Contemporary Builds**
New-build developments and architect-designed homes that benefit from interior design to add warmth and personality to pristine spaces.

## Designing for Country Living

Surrey living tends to be more relaxed than London, with homes that accommodate dogs, horses, and outdoor pursuits. Interiors need to be welcoming and practical while maintaining elegance.

**Durable Materials**
Natural stone floors, robust fabrics, and finishes that improve with age. We select materials that handle the wear and tear of country life while looking beautiful.

**Warmth and Comfort**
Open fires, layered textiles, and considered lighting create spaces that feel cosy in winter while remaining fresh in summer.

## Our Surrey Projects

We work throughout the county, from the stockbroker belt to the Surrey Hills:

- Farmhouse renovation near Guildford
- Contemporary family home in Esher
- Grade II listed cottage in Shere
- New-build interior design in Cobham
- Kitchen and boot room design in Weybridge

## Practical Considerations

Surrey properties often present specific challenges:

**Access and Logistics**
Remote locations, narrow lanes, and delivery restrictions require careful project management.

**Local Suppliers**
We have developed relationships with Surrey-based craftspeople, from bespoke furniture makers to specialist plasterers.

**Planning and Conservation**
Many Surrey villages have strict planning controls. We navigate these requirements to achieve designs that satisfy both homeowners and planning authorities.

## Working Across the South East

While based in London, we regularly travel to Surrey projects and have built a network of trusted contractors and suppliers throughout the county. This local knowledge ensures smooth project delivery regardless of location.
