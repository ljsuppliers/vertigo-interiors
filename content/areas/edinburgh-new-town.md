Edinburgh's New Town stands as one of the finest examples of Georgian town planning in the world. These elegant streets, with their uniform facades and generous proportions, present unique opportunities—and challenges—for interior design.

At Vertigo Interiors, we've worked extensively in the New Town, helping homeowners create contemporary interiors that honour their buildings' exceptional heritage.

## Understanding New Town Architecture

New Town properties typically feature:

- Generous ceiling heights (often 3 metres or more)
- Elegant cornicing and ceiling roses
- Working fireplaces with period surrounds
- Large sash windows flooding rooms with light
- Classical proportions that reward considered design

These features aren't obstacles to modern living—they're assets. Our approach celebrates rather than conceals them.

## Common Design Challenges

### Light and Proportion

Basement flats and north-facing rooms require careful planning to maximise available light. We use:

- Strategically placed mirrors
- Lighter colour palettes where appropriate
- Layered lighting schemes
- Reflective surfaces and materials

### Period vs Contemporary

The tension between preservation and practicality requires balance. We help clients:

- Restore original features to their former glory
- Integrate modern amenities invisibly
- Choose furniture that complements without competing
- Create comfortable contemporary spaces within historic shells

### Kitchen and Bathroom Updates

Period properties rarely had the kitchens or bathrooms we expect today. Our designs:

- Maximise space in awkward layouts
- Conceal modern appliances elegantly
- Work within listed building constraints
- Respect the building's character

## Our New Town Process

Working in New Town requires sensitivity and expertise. Our approach includes:

1. **Heritage Assessment** — Understanding your property's history and any listing restrictions
2. **Architectural Analysis** — Identifying original features worth preserving or restoring
3. **Space Planning** — Optimising layouts for modern living
4. **Material Selection** — Choosing finishes that complement period details
5. **Procurement** — Sourcing appropriate furniture and furnishings
6. **Installation** — Managing works with care for irreplaceable features

## Featured New Town Projects

We've completed projects throughout the New Town, including:

- A comprehensive renovation of a Heriot Row townhouse
- Kitchen and bathroom updates for a Moray Place flat
- Living room redesign in a Drummond Place property
- Full interior design for a Great King Street apartment
