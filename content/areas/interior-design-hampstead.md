Hampstead combines village charm with metropolitan sophistication. Its tree-lined streets, period architecture, and proximity to the Heath make it one of London's most sought-after residential areas.

## Designing for Hampstead Living

Hampstead attracts families, professionals, and creatives who value space, greenery, and a sense of community. Homes here tend to be larger than in central London, with gardens and multiple floors that offer interesting design possibilities.

**Victorian and Edwardian Villas**
The neighbourhood is characterised by substantial Victorian and Edwardian properties with original features including cornicing, fireplaces, and wooden floors. Our designs celebrate these elements while introducing modern comfort.

**Arts and Crafts Influences**
Hampstead has a rich artistic heritage, and many properties reflect Arts and Crafts sensibilities. We often draw on these influences when creating schemes that feel authentic to the area.

## Family-Focused Design

Many of our Hampstead clients are families who need their homes to work hard. We design kitchens that accommodate homework sessions and dinner parties, living spaces that transition from playroom to adult entertaining, and bedrooms that grow with children.

**Practical Luxury**
Beautiful materials and finishes that withstand the realities of family life. Durable fabrics, wipeable surfaces, and clever storage solutions that maintain aesthetic appeal.

**Flexible Spaces**
Open-plan designs that zone effectively, creating distinct areas for different activities without sacrificing flow and light.

## Our Hampstead Experience

We have worked extensively in Hampstead and the surrounding areas of Belsize Park, Highgate, and Primrose Hill. This local knowledge informs our understanding of what works in these homes and what the area's discerning residents expect.

Recent projects include:

- Six-bedroom family home renovation in Hampstead Village
- Kitchen extension and redesign in Belsize Park
- Master suite with dressing room in Highgate
- Garden flat conversion in Primrose Hill

## The Design Process

Every project begins with a thorough understanding of how you live. We visit your home, discuss your daily routines, and explore your aesthetic preferences before presenting concepts. This ensures the final design genuinely reflects your lifestyle rather than imposing a predetermined style.
