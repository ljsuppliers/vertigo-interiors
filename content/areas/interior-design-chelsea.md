Chelsea has long been synonymous with refined taste and elegant living. As one of London's most desirable neighbourhoods, it attracts homeowners who appreciate quality craftsmanship, timeless design, and attention to detail.

## Why Chelsea Homes Need Specialist Design

Chelsea's architectural heritage presents unique opportunities and challenges. From Georgian townhouses to Victorian conversions and modern riverside apartments, each property type requires a different approach.

**Period Properties**
Many Chelsea homes feature original architectural details, high ceilings, and generous proportions. Our approach preserves these heritage elements while introducing contemporary comfort and functionality.

**Contemporary Spaces**
Newer developments along the Thames and in Chelsea Harbour offer open-plan living with floor-to-ceiling windows. These spaces call for a different design language that maximises light and views.

## Our Chelsea Projects

We have completed numerous projects across Chelsea, from full home renovations to individual room designs:

- Complete townhouse refurbishment in Cheyne Walk
- Kitchen and living space redesign in Chelsea Manor Street
- Master suite renovation in Beaufort Street
- Contemporary apartment styling in Chelsea Harbour

## Services for Chelsea Homeowners

From initial concept through to installation, we manage every aspect of your interior transformation.

**Room-by-Room Design**

**Consultation Services**
Expert advice on colour schemes, furniture selection, and spatial planning for those who prefer a guided DIY approach.

## Working With Listed Properties

Many Chelsea homes fall within conservation areas or are themselves listed buildings. We have extensive experience working within these constraints, liaising with local planning authorities and conservation officers to achieve beautiful results that respect the property's heritage.
