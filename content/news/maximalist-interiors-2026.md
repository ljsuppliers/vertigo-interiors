## Introduction

The pendulum is swinging. After nearly a decade where "less is more" dominated interior design discourse, maximalism is staging a confident return, though not quite as you might remember it.

This isn't the cluttered chaos of decades past. Today's maximalism is curated, intentional, and deeply personal. At Vertigo Interiors, we're helping clients embrace this shift in ways that feel authentic rather than overwhelming.

## What's Driving the Change

Several factors are converging to fuel this trend:

- A desire for individuality after years of samey, Instagram-influenced interiors
- Post-pandemic appreciation for homes that truly reflect personality
- Growing confidence in mixing periods, styles, and cultures
- Rejection of disposable, trend-driven purchasing

People want their homes to tell stories, and minimalism often left those stories untold.

## How to Embrace Maximalism Thoughtfully

The key to successful maximalist design lies in curation rather than accumulation. Consider these principles:

**Choose a Cohesive Foundation**

Even bold spaces need grounding. Select a colour palette of three to five tones that recur throughout, creating visual rhythm amidst the abundance.

**Layer with Purpose**

Each piece should earn its place. Ask whether items add meaning, beauty, or function before introducing them.

**Edit Ruthlessly**

Maximalism doesn't mean everything stays. Regular editing keeps spaces vibrant rather than stagnant.

## The Edinburgh Perspective

Scotland's design heritage lends itself beautifully to considered maximalism. Rich tartans, antique furniture, and layered textures feel natural in Georgian townhouses and Victorian villas alike.

We're seeing clients embrace bold wallpapers, gallery walls of collected art, and rooms that evolve over time rather than arriving fully formed.

## Looking Forward

This maximalist moment feels different from previous iterations. It's less about excess and more about expression. Expect this trend to develop throughout 2026, with interiors becoming ever more personal, layered, and characterful.

At Vertigo Interiors, we welcome this shift. After all, the most interesting spaces have always been those with something to say.
